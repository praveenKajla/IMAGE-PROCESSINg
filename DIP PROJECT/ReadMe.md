•	Here the HAE folder is the main project based on the research paper
•	HAE – Hierarchical Air light Estimation estimates air light using the proposed method in the paper but the final output image is extracted using DCP(Dark Channel Prior) Method
•	So I have also included the whole Dark Channel Prior Process which estimates airlight pixels using top 0.1% median pixels (Instead hierarchically as in HAE)
•	So just a comparison could be established between end results.



Thank You !
